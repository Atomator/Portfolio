          I have had a passion for everything programming for a long time and while that is good for me, it also means that I have created numerous different projects from all sorts of different fields. Currently I have been working with numerous technologies all the way from AR/VR with Unity, to ML with Tensorflow and Pytorch, to Web Development with Vuejs and Firebase. While I not sure exactly what I am going to do yet, Iâ€™m working on it; one step at a time.
